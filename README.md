Hello if your finding this through my CV please check out the snakemake kaillisto repo. 
Most of my work as a bioinformatican has been in industry so I do not have quite as much 
in my git repo as bioinformatican working in academia. I've put togtheir a small snakemake
project that combines python, R and linux to analyse single-read RNA-Seq.

I've also got a small Rshiny app in the simple_shiny repo but I am currently
focused on learning streamlit for webapps and quarto for report building.

If you have any questions about my projects or suggestions about something else I should
work on (currently working on a scRNA-Seq proejct) let me know at alexraeside@gmail.com
.
p.s. I will eventually have a finsihed Godot project here at somepoint, new years resolution.
