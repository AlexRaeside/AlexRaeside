Hello!


If you're finding this through my CV, please check out my Snakemake Kallisto repo. As most of my work as a bioinformatician has been in industry, so I do not have quite as much in my git repo as bioinformatician working in academia. I've put a small snakemake project that combines python, R and Linux to analyse single-end RNA-Seq and the scRNA-Seq pipeline involves the intergation of two white blood cell datasets using Seurat but yet to tidy that up fully.

I've also got a small Rshiny app in the simple_shiny repo, but I am currently focused on learning quarto for report building, so don't expect any more rshiny apps for the time being. There will be a quarto blog attached to this git at some point.


If you have any questions about my projects or suggestions about something else I should work on (currently tidying the scRNA-Seq project and working on the blog), let me know at alexraeside@gmail.com


p.s. I will eventually have a finished Godot project here at some point, new years resolution.
